# Procedurally generated environment
This is an experiment that uses three.js and Jerome Etienne's threex.js ; The code is uploaded both on codepen and github to play and experiment with. The object is there, question is : what can you do with it? (check out the amazing stuff http://www.makemepulse.com/ does with a similar initial object)

#Demo
You can play around with [a fully functional live demo on Codepen](http://codepen.io/marctannous/pen/RNGjmz), or get the code from github.
