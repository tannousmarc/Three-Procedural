# Procedurally generated environment
This is an experiment that uses three.js and Jerome Etienne's threex.js ; The code is uploaded both on codepen and github to play and experiment with. The object is there, question is : what can you do with it? (check out the amazing stuff http://www.makemepulse.com/ does with a similar initial object)

# Demo
You can see [a fully functional live demo](http://www.tannousmarc.com/projects/threeX/index) on my webpage.

If simply watching is not quite your cup of tea, [play with the code instantly in the browser](http://codepen.io/marctannous/pen/RNGjmz) or fork the project on github.

# Adaptations
[@clindsey on codepen generated highlander final fight scene location](http://codepen.io/clindsey/details/yJqwXP)

# Known issues
- Mobile spacing is off, font size and line height as well.
- Rendering on older machines takes a while ; Maybe implement a preloader?
